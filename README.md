Hi, i'm Chaoqin Chen. You can call me Vince. If I can use one sentence to discribe my career, then it will be "I want to be a world influence programmer, and make future great for all people." This goal is my first point. I know it's hard, but it's also possible. Start today, and see how far I can run.
